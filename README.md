# SMS-Spam-Classifier
In this project, I have performed classification of user entered text as 'SPAM' or 'NOT SPAM'.  

After performing Data cleaning, visualization and Feature Extraction on our dataset, a Naive bayes model (mnb) is trained for classification of the text as it provides with the best Accuracy score(97%) & Precision score(100%).  
The project is deployed using Heroku as a Streamlit Web-App.
